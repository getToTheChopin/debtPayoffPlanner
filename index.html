        <p><b>Total Monthly Payment:</b> Must be greater than or equal to the minimum monthly payments on all of your loans combined</p>
        <p><b>Payment Type: </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Avalanche</b> means that your excess payments (above and beyond your loan minimum payments) are used to pay off your loans with the <b>highest interest rate</b> first</li>
            <li><b>Snowball</b> means that your excess payments are used to pay off your loans with the <b>smallest balances</b> first</li>
            <li>The avalanche method is optimal from a mathematical perspective -- it allows you to minimize the total interest paid across your loans</li>
            <li>However, the snowball method allows you to pay off your small loans faster than in the avalanche method. Racking up quick wins can provide motivation to stay on track with your debt repayment strategy</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Compounding:</b> This tool assumes that all of the loans use monthly compounding to calculate the interest payments</p>

            <p>Typically, the avalanche method allows you to become debt-free more quickly, and allows you to pay less interest in total.</p>
            <p>However, the results of the two methods can be the same if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You only have a single loan to pay off</li>
                <li>Your total monthly payment is equal to the minimum monthly payments of all of your loans combined (i.e., there isn't "excess" money that can be used to pay off your loans more quickly)</li>
                <li>The loans with the smallest balances are also the loans with the highest interest rates -- meaning that the two methods produce the same priority ranking</li>
            </ul>
