A web tool that can help you pay off your debts:

* Organize your loans in one place
* Crunch the numbers to determine the total cost of your loans (interest + principal), and the date when each of your loans will be paid off
* Design a month-by-month plan to get you from today to your debt-free future
* Perform what-if analyses that illustrate how the final answers change if we tweak the assumptions
